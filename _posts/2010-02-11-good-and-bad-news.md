Well, the good news is that I did a new personal record for 3 miles today. I think Thursday is my good day. The details are below.

The bad news is that I think I might be developing a case of [shin splints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_splints). Might right leg is particularly bad and I felt a twinge of pain in my left leg today. If you have any advice, let me know and I'll be seeking some advice as well from around the 'nets. Until I figure out exactly what to do I will probably tone down my walking pace and cut out the jogging, especially for my 7 miles I am going to do on Saturday. I'd rather tone it down now and still be able to train to some extent rather than waiting until it gets so bad that I can't train at all.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked and jogged (8 minutes) 3 miles in 39 minutes and 19 seconds (4.58 mph, beating my previous record by 6 seconds)
