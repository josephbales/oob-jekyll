title: Weight Loss Goals

I will keep this simple, for your sake and mine. My weight loss goals are very straight forward.

Goal 1: Get to 280 lbs by March 1, 2016. This is a fairly aggressive goal considering it was set on February 18, 2016 and my start weight was 288. I think I can do it though.

Goal 2: Lose 10 lbs per month through the end of the year. This puts me at 180 lbs on January 1, 2017.

That’s it. 10 pounds a month is a lot, but very doable at my weight. At the beginning of each month I will re-evaluate my goals and see if I need to make any changes.

Final Goal: Don’t get discouraged and quit if I miss a goal or two. I can do this.
