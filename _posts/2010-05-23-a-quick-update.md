Yes, I'm still alive and running.  I've had quite a case of "Not Wanting to Update This Blog" here lately.  The past month has been pretty eventful here in the Nashville area with the floods and in my personal life too.  I'll get back to posting on a more regular basis in a couple of weeks.  In the meantime I've updated the [Photos](http://outofbreath.org/photos/) page with some pictures I took of myself today.  Check out my progress!
