After only a few posts I abandoned this blog (and my quest for good health). I'm picking up where I left off two and a half years ago. I'm still overweight and still struggling to get healthy. Since the beginning of this year, I have really been watching how much food I have been eating. Notice I said "how much" and not "what." Right now I feel like it is much more important to reduce the overall amount of food I take in rather than try to eat only foods that I deem healthy.

What started me back on this path? Well, I've been wanting for several years to walk a half marathon. So I got together with some friends at work and signed up for the half marathon here in Nashville at the end of April. In order to walk 13.1 miles in less than 4 hours, I'll need to drop a few pounds and, more importantly, build up my stamina. But this is just a short term goal. I'm back on this blog because I have long term goals I want to achieve and I'm no spring chicken, so I need to get started pronto.

Long term goals:

* Reduce my weight to 179lbs and maintain it there indefinitely.
* Run a half marathon.
* Run a full marathon.
* Participate in a cycling event (still need to research this one).
* Do a triathlon.

I know I can do all of these things. I just have to set my mind to it.

I'll also be posting my weight loss results and any training I do for the half marathon here.

**Today's results are:**
Weight: 249.6 lbs (the least I've weight in years, it still makes a good starting point)
Waistline: 48.75 inches (as measured at my true waist directly below my belly button)
Exercise: Walked 5.9 miles in 1.72 hours (too ambitious for the first day, I'll be paying for this tomorrow)
