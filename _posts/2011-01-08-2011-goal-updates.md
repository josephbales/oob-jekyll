I thought I'd start off the new year with some righteous running socks. They are [Injinji](http://www.injinji.com) Toesocks. Not only do they scare my relatives, they also fit nice, are warm, and they don't have any of those pesky seams that rub me raw. I bought a pair on a whim at [Team Nashville](http://www.teamnashvillesports.com/) (I need to get in there more, just to talk to Terry) and I've run in them twice. Once you get over the initial weird feeling of cloth between toes, they feel great. Normally, I can feel my socks when I'm running, and not in a good way. They feel like the are constricting around my toes and bunching them up. These socks allow my toes to roam free and I almost don't notice them. I've tried several brands of running socks and so far these are my favorites (sorry [Belega](http://www.balegasports.com/), you had a good run). Of course now that these have tested well... Terry, here I come!

Now on to the updates I promised in the title. I'm already well on my way to my goal weight.  I've lost 8 lbs since mid-December (current weight 212.4), mostly thanks to a website called [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com). The web site takes your current stats, asks you a few questions about your weight loss goals and life style, then generates a daily calorie goal. You then update the site with the food you eat and the exercise you do. It does all the math and keeps a running total of how many calories you have left. For example, based on me wanting to lose 2 lbs per week, my lifestyle (light activity), and my current weight, the site says I need to eat about 1600 calories a day. Now, if I were to burn 400 calories exercising, the web site would add that to my total giving me 2000 calories to eat that day.  As long as I don't go over my calorie limit (whatever it may be), I should lose 2 pounds per week.  So far it seems to be working just fine.

I also took a step towards spending less time on the internet by canceling my DSL. I can still tether my laptop to my Android phone and get internet access, but that one step has already reduced the amount of time I'm online.  It also saves me the money on DSL service and that will help me towards my goal of paying off my credit card debt. And speaking of that, I'm probably getting a huge tax refund this year. I've already planned out how I'm going to use it all to pay down my credit card debt. If my calculations hold true, I should be able to cut it in half!

I've already made a little progress on some other goals too, but I'll leave that for another post. **Now go get you some toesocks!**
