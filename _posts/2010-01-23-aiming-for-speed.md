My plan is to walk the [Nashville 1/2 marathon](http://nashville.competitor.com/) in April (the 24th to be exact).  Actually, I plan to walk it in under 3.5 hours.  But now I'm thinking I might be able to walk it in 3 hours.  This would require me to walk at a pace of 4.3667 mph.  So as part of my training, I decided to start aiming for speed as well as distance.

When I walked today I did make one error.  I did not warm up and immediately started out at a fast pace.  My legs hurt and burned for the first mile, but I did not slow down since I was already committed to that pace.  Once I pushed past the first mile, I loosened up and started to feel better.  I think I might have to start taking a lap around the parking lot at my apartment complex to warm up before heading over to the [greenway (PDF)](http://www.nashville.gov/greenways/pdfs/maps/SRStonesRiver.pdf) to walk.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked 4.5 miles in 1 hour and 5 minutes (4.15 mph)
