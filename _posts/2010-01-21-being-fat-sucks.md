I was thinking today as I was walking that being fat really sucks. It makes you feel bad, ruins your self esteem, makes it hard to find clothing that fits, and makes it hard to do anything athletic. I think being not fat is probably the best way to go.

Today I splurged and ate a pork bbq sandwich for lunch. It wasn't much of a splurge really, it was just a sandwich like I might normally eat. The place I got it at has sandwiches for a dollar off on Wednesdays, so I might go get one once a week. Tennessee pork bbq is awesome if you've never had it.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked 3.0 miles in 47 minutes (that's 3.8 mph, a good pace although I'd like to work it up to 4 mph by marathon time)
