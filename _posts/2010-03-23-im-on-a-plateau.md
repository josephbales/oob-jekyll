Well, the good news is that my weight is at 227.2 lbs which is a loss of 35.8 lbs since my January 1st weight of 263.0 lbs. The bad news is that it is also the same weight I posted two weeks ago. I'm officially on a weight loss plateau. I've never really had to deal with this situation before and I'm not quite sure how to handle it, although I do have a few ideas.

First, I've engaged in some moderate to heavy drinking the past couple of weekends and I think this has been the main contributing factor to my inability to lose weight. So I'm thinking that this weekend I will not have anything to drink (and good thing since I'm also broke!) and will limit my alcohol intake in the future as well. I might also try doing more hard liquor shots and less beer drinking if I should partake.

I've also not been watching my caloric intake as closely the past couple of weeks. I've been doing a lot of guesstimating about how much I'm eating and not really paying attention. I'm pretty sure my portion and meal sizes have crept up as a result. I've also done a lot of "justified" eating, i.e. eating more because I'm burning more calories by running.

In addition to not binge drinking on the weekend, I'll also be watching what I eat more carefully and changing my eating patterns. I'll be eating more for my first meal and less at each subsequent meal and I'll try not to eat anything within 2 hours of bedtime. Hopefully I'll have some sort of weight loss to report next week.

**Site note:** I am no longer putting updates on my runs in my posts. Instead there is a link in the sidebar called [My Running Stats](http://www.runningahead.com/logs/4f7d3c575b9f42c3b8e8865f58985273). You can click it to see the latest. I've also put the link on the Progress page.
