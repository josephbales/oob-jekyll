My plan today was to walk 5 miles.  However, yesterday an event occurred here in Nashville that we are simply referring to as [#TheSituation2010](http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/29/happy-hour-snow-day/).  Okay, so it snowed about 4 inches.  Normally an event such as this would start the slow doom of any weight loss/exercise plan that I had started.  But this time I am determined and neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night shall stay me from my appointed [goal](http://nashville.competitor.com/).

I would say that I walked 5 miles today, but that's too simple.  It was more of a journey.  On the one hand, there were spinning cars, people trying to sled over me, people trying to drive over me, 4 inches of snow to trudge through, and slick patches of ice to tiptoe over.  But there was also great beauty in the lonely greenway trail and a sense of accomplishment when I returned home.

Again I experimented with slow jogging during my walk.  I jogged for one minute at a time at irregular intervals, mostly depending on the footing.  I did not count the exact number of times I jogged, but it was at least 8 times.  My normal walking pace was much slower, but as I said above, there where many perils and quite a bit of trudging that had to be done.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked 5 miles in 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 44 seconds (3.38 mph, off the pace, but pretty good considering the conditions)
