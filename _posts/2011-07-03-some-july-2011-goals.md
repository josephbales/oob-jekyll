[caption id="attachment_484" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="Eyes on the prize"][last post](http://outofbreath.org/2011/06/27/so-what-happened/) was all about my long term yearly goals. Today I'm going to set some short term health related goals.

My first goal is for the race I have coming up tomorrow.  It's the Firecracker 5K in Brentwood and my main goal is sub-30 minutes (a 9:38 min/mile pace). This is based on my training runs of late and I am confident in my ability to reach this goal in a safe and injury free manner.  My stretch goal will be a time under 29 minutes (a 9:20 pace).  I've done some intervals at that pace, but I'm not certain I can maintain it for the entire length of the race and remain injury free.

My focus on not getting injured is because of my next goal, running at least 110 miles in July.  In fact, this small goal is part of my longer term strategy to run 840 miles this year.  To do so I'm going to have to make up for some lost time.  By running 110 miles a month for the rest of the year, I will hit 840 miles, but the key will be not to get injured.  My strategy will be to run at least 5 km (3.11 miles) every day with a long run on the weekend of not less that 8 miles.  These runs will be at a slow pace with maybe one tempo run or speed session per week.

The final goal will be to lose 15 lbs in the month of July.  My weight at the start of the month was 221 lbs and my ending weight will be 206 lbs.  I know I can do this and I know I can do it safely.  After a year and a half of running and dieting, I know how much my body needs to function and when I can push it and when I need to back off.  Plus, losing 15 lbs in a month is a lot easier and less risky at 221 lbs than if I started at a lower weight.  The key here will be to keep my caloric intake in the 1300 calorie per day range except on the days that I do long runs where it will need to be in the 2000 calorie range or more depending on the length of the run.

That's it for now.  I'll post updates throughout the month on these goals and I'll do a wrap up post at the end of the month so see where I came out.
