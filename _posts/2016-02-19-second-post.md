Today I tried to watch what I was eating and was mostly successful. I fixed a steak for myself last night and I wanted to finish it tonight because I had leftovers and didnâ€™t want a good steak to go to waste.

So I ate sparingly today, went for a 3 mile walk (50 minutes), and then came home and finished off the steak. Tomorrow the plan is to eat only breakfast and lunch and do another 3 or more mile walk.
