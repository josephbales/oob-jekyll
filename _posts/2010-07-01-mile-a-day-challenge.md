Okay, here's a challenge that is so easy to do that I might mess it up by just forgetting about it.  The challenge is to run or walk at least one mile every day for the month of July.  I'm doing it *because* it is easy and it gives me a goal to work towards.  Also, it will help get me up and running every day so that I am less inclined to be lazy.  Day 1 is already in the books with a 5K run at [Mill Creek Greenway](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=114351316891271919778.0004506a5987fc9a01803&amp;t=h&amp;z=16).  I didn't get this challenge from any other web site, I just made it up this morning while driving home from work.  If anyone decides to do this one, let me know in the comments.

Also, I'm still doing the Firecracker 5K this weekend at the Maryland Farms YMCA in Brentwood.  There will be a few people there that I know, so it should be a fun event.  Come on out and race with us!

One note about my data collection.  I recently purchased a [Garmin Forerunner 305](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&amp;pID=349) and am now recording my runs with that.  I think my Nike+ was cheating me out of distance, especially on runs longer than 7 miles.  So if my pace seems a bit quicker, it is probably just due to more accurate distance and time measurement.  Also, my previous convention of calling runs longer than 6 miles "long" runs is out the door.  Now it has to be 8 miles to be long.
