Building up to the [Nashville 1/2 marathon](http://nashville.competitor.com/) in late April, I've discovered that is it good to have a plan. So thanks to Kevin at work (who said he was going to do the 1/2 marathon, but will probably chicken out), I found a [plan that I am following](http://www.marathonwalking.com/schedule_ez_half.html) at the [Marathon Walking](http://www.marathonwalking.com/) website.  Here is the plan I'm following. I'm on Tuesday of week 2.

I've yet to start any of the cross training, but I'm starting that tomorrow. My apartment complex has two fitness rooms, so I'll probably be hitting the elliptical or the exercise bike. As the weather warms up, I'll be riding my bike as part of my cross training effort.

**Training update:**
Weight: 246.6 lbs (a loss of 3 lbs in 1 week, very good!)
Exercise: Walked 3 miles in 44 minutes and 38 seconds (4.03 mph)
