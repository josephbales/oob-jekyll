I decided that today would be bread and water day.  So it's nothing but bread and water today.  Actually it's toast, but close enough.  I'm eating Wheat Wonder Bread Lite toasted in a regular toaster.  I've been having some digestive problems lately and thought this would be a good way to settle my stomach.  So far it seems to be working, but I have heard some rumbling that I don't like.

I've also taken some vitamin E and low-dose aspirin.  I've been a little concerned about my blood pressure lately.  It's not high, but it is on the high side of normal which disturbs me a bit.  I thought the aspirin might help with that.  The vitamin E is for help with healing my skin.  I've got a couple of wounds that haven't really healed up very quickly and I thought maybe I might be a little deficient in vitamin E, but who knows.  The vitamin E is also supposed to help with heart disease.  I'm not taking much, so I guess it can't hurt.

Tomorrow I'm going to have fruit and nut day.  I've got some apple and blueberries in the fridge and some walnuts and peanuts in the cupboard.  I might have to go to the grocery store and get some extra fruit though because those blueberries might be bad and I'll probably need more anyway.  I'm planning on Saturday being Veggie day so I'll definitely need a trip to the grocery for that.
