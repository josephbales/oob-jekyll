Lately I've been incredibly focused on two things, running and losing weight. Up until yesterday I was doing pretty good at both. I've lost 30 pounds since January 1 and I've steadily increased the speed and amount I can run. But that all came crashing down yesterday morning.

It happened at mile two of my 2.5 mile run yesterday. I had been struggling with the run from the start. I was breathing hard and my form was jerky and got ragged after only a mile. By mile 2 my body started talking to me. It told me to stop running and I did. I walked the half mile back to my car. I was mad more than anything.

You see, I knew what was going on. That day I'd had about 20 oz. of water, 1 bag of Cheetos, 1 small bag of cookies, a large cup of coffee, and half a bag of pork rinds. That ladies and gentlemen is the junk food/starvation diet I've been living on since January. Well, not exactly that, but you get the idea. It's utterly ridiculous and it's going to have to stop. I put a post on the [Nashville Striders](http://www.nashvillestriders.com/) forum asking what I should do. I went to bed thinking about how I needed to change my eating habits.

I got up last night and stopped at Sonic to get a combo meal to eat on my way to work. At that point I still hadn't eaten anything since the pork rinds and I needed something in my body. I was sore and aching and basically malnourished. The food made be feel a little better, but it was still more junk food. The Striders gave me the 'ol [Michael Pollan](http://www.michaelpollan.com/), "Eat food, mostly plants," or as one poster put it, "eat stuff that grows." I knew this already, but sometimes I need a kick in the pants to help me out. Another poster told me I needed to drink a gallon of water a day. This is also probably good advice since I consistently weigh 2 lbs less after running than I do before.

Up until now I've only watched *how much* I've been eating. From this point forward, I also need to pay attention to *what* I am eating.

And so that this post has a happy ending, I ran 4 miles today at a ridiculously slow pace and finished strong.
