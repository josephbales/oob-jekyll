I'm going to keep this short tonight since I'm posting from work on my lunch break. My DSL is out right now for some reason and a technician is coming in tomorrow to take a look at it. I did more jogging today as I jogged for 1 minute for every 5 minutes of walking, a total of 7 minutes jogging. My pace was way up now that the snow is clear.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked and jogged 3 miles in 39 minutes and 24 seconds (4.57 mph)
