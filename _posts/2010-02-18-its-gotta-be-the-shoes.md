Today was my second day out with my new shoes from [Fleet Feet Sports](http://fleetfeetnashville.com/). I have to say that the leg pain I've been experiencing was not as bad today and it *could* be the shoes. Of course it could be the other things I'm doing differently as well.

* A slow walking warmup around the parking lot and for the first quarter mile.
* No pre-walk stretches.
* A much slower running pace that is barely faster than my walk.
* Daily use of [The Stick](http://www.thestick.com/) to loosen up my muscles.
* Getting more experience running.
* Post-walk stretching.

I also did something today I thought quite impossible last week. I ran 1 mile. Actually, I ran 2.25 miles in total, but the first mile was the real ground breaker. I have not run a mile since I was 8 years old (a quarter century!) The key was my significantly reduced running speed. I started off with a slow walk for the first quarter mile, then started my slow run just as I caught up to a guy talking on his cell phone and a woman being dragged by two feisty dogs. I then planned to run a half mile, but felt good enough to keep going on for a mile. I walked the next half mile, then ran from there to the end.

I didn't break my best time for the 3 miler, that is how much slower I was running. I did try to break my record, sprinting the last 200 feet, but came 12 seconds shy of a new record. That little sprint was a bad idea, but it does show how motivated I am and how much energy I still had in the tank at the end. Saturday is 8 miles. I'm not sure how much of that I will run, but I'll probably take the first few miles pretty easy.

**Training update:**
Exercise: Walked and ran 3 miles in 39 minutes and 30 seconds (4.56 mph with 2.25 miles of that running)
