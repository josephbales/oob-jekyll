One of my original motives for losing weight was to go sky diving.  On a recent trip to Las Vegas, I decided to do the [SkyJump](http://www.skyjumplasvegas.com) off the Stratosphere Tower.  It's a controlled free fall where they attach a cable to your back, throw you over the edge of the building (855 feet above the pavement), and 40 feet from the ground the cable slows you to a soft landing.  Here are some pictures from the top with the SkyJump crew (who spoke with 1930s Chicago gangster accents the whole time).

It was awesome, so I decided to up the ante and go for the full sky diving experience at [Sky Dive Las Vegas](http://www.skydivelasvegas.com/). If you ever get the chance to jump out of a plane, I say do it.  And if I hadn't started running and losing weight, I never would have had videos like the one below to post.
