Last year when I started this whole running business, I [followed a training schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-01-26-training-schedule %}) that I found on some random website.  That worked out pretty well for me, so I decided to create my own schedule for training this next year.  My first big goal race, or races I should say, are the [Tom King Classic 5K and half marathon](http://www.tomkingclassic.com/) here in Nashville (my first double).  My new training schedule will get me prepped for this by having several split runs were I run 3 miles, then some longer distance. Click on the icon below to view my new training schedule (created using Google Docs).

Feel free to check it out and offer suggestions or tips.  I'm also working on a new weight loss plan and that will be the subject of my next post which should be in a few days.
