Nothing new to report today. I upped my walking/jogging ratio to 4:1 for a total of 8 minutes jogging.

**Training update:**
Weight: 240.6 lbs (1.4 lbs lost since last week)
Waistline: 46.25 inches (that's 2.5 inches lost since I started tracking)
Exercise: Walked and jogged 3 miles in 39 minutes and 50 seconds (4.52 mph)
