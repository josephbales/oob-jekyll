Today I tried out two new pieces of equipment on my walk/jog.  The first piece were may brand new pants that I bought last week.  I actually wore them on Saturday, but since it was so cold I also wore some of my giant old jogging pants over them.  Today I used them solo and the new pants work GREAT!  They didn't budge an inch while I was on my walk, even while I was jogging.  They also don't make an annoying "swish-swish" sound which is a plus in my book.

The second new piece is a [Sansa Fuze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansa_Fuze) mp3 player.  My old player was a AAA battery hog, the sound quality was questionable at best, and you had to scroll through every song just to pick the one you wanted.  The new one has a better UI, better battery life, and the sound quality is much better although the ear buds that came with it are crap.  My Skullcandy earbuds sound much better, but they keep falling out while I'm jogging so I'm probably going to spring for some of those kind that clip over the ear at some point.

My pace today was again slowed on my walk due to the effects of [#TheSituation2010](http://hashtags.org/thesituation2010).  Jogging is starting to become a regular part of my walking sessions.  After the first ten minutes of walking, I jogged for one minute, then walked for 5 minutes.  The last jogging session was for 2 minutes.  I jogged for a total of 7 minutes today.

**Training update:**
Weight: 242.0 lbs (a loss of 4.6 lbs in 1 week, this is what I weighed in high school)
Exercise: Walked and jogged 3 miles in 44 minutes and 52 seconds (4.01 mph)
