After getting my butt kicked today on my first 80 degree day run, I thought I'd give a bit of an update.

First, I totally went out and did the butt kicking on Sunday, running 8 miles and doing 10K of it in less than my goal time of 1:10:00. I'm not sure exactly what my time was, but I know that I did 6.25 miles in 1:09:00ish time, so it was maybe in the 1:08:00 range. This was a big win after my little [disaster on Saturday](http://outofbreath.org/life/2010/03/27/clinically-insane.html).

I've had some pretty typical runs since then until today. It was over 80&deg; when I started running today and it really sapped my energy starting at about mile 2.5 (of a 5 mile run). I ended up walking the last mile just so I wouldn't keel over and die of heat exhaustion on the greenway. I'm thinking I need to start running in the early morning again to avoid the heat of the day and cut down on my sun exposure.

I've also decided to participate in the [Weekend Warriors Challenge](http://solongfatass.com/2010/03/29/weekend-warriors-challenge-the-empire-strikes-back/). So to that end I am setting up a few "specific and measurable" goals for this weekend.

1. Run at least two miles after getting off work Friday morning at a 10:55 or better pace.
2. No alcohol, beer, or fast food from from Friday through Sunday.
3. Map out a safe route and run from my apartment in Hermitage to my best friend's apartment in Nashville (this should be almost exactly 13.1 miles) on Saturday.
4. Man up and run 4 miles on Sunday. Some pretty good goals, huh? A tip of the hat to Scott at [MinusFiveTimesTen](http://minus5times10.wordpress.com/) for pointing me to the challenge. I'll post my results on Monday.
