If you don't check my [Events](http://joeyshealth.wordpress.com/events) page on a regular basis, you may have missed that I signed up for the [Firecracker 5K](http://www.ymcamidtn.org/) on Saturday July 3, 2010.  The sole purpose of this run will be to break 30 minutes at the 5K distance.  I have never done this before and never even made the attempt, but I know I have the speed to do it.

The plan is to show up early, push through the crowd to get in front of the walkers, and then have at it!  I'll try to get near someone else who is planning to run a sub 30 and see if we can pace each other if practical.  Failure is not an option on this one.  I will be putting it all on the line to get it done.
