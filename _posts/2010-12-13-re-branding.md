I decided recently to re-brand this website and call it "Out of Breath" ([http://outofbreath.org](http://outofbreath.org)) in case you want to update your bookmarks, links, and feeds).  I got the seed of this idea in Vegas and that seed germinated while running through Shelby Bottoms a couple of weeks ago.  I was thinking about my jumping out of buildings and airplanes adventures in Las Vegas and noticed that in both cases I was out of breath at the end.  I decided this would be a good name for a blog and a good way to live a life.  If you're out of breath at the end of an activity, that is generally a sign that you have given your all and that's what I want to do when I'm out there running, jumping, or doing whatever in my life.  You only get one life and if you aren't out of breath at the end of whatever you have done, then you've probably missed out on something along the way.

So to that end, I'll be recommitting myself to running and eating better and living a better life overall.  Over the next few days I'll be posting a new training program for my upcoming races and will also start posting my weight loss progress again. I'd also like for you, my dear readers, to continue to read along, comment, offer advice, and hold me accountable.

Let's do this!
