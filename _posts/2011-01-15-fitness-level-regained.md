It's been a <a href="http://outofbreath.org/2010/04/05/wwc-challenge-results/">**long** time</a> since I've reported on a training run, but as I sat here playing with the settings on my blog, I decided that my run today was pretty significant.  I did 3 miles in 26:22.45, an 8:48 pace (runners measure their speed in pace which is minutes per mile or if you're from any other country besides the USA, minutes per kilometer).  I went back and reviewed all of my running stats and discovered that I am now back to the fitness level I was at in July and August of last year.  That was the peak of my fitness.  I am now running even faster and with less pain as well.

I'm also nearing my previous record low weight of 207 lbs which I recorded on August 30, 2010.  After bumbling my way back up to 220 lbs right before the holidays, I've managed to knock 8 lbs off of that already.  Last week's official weigh-in was 211.8 lbs, and I'm on track for another pound or two of loss this week as well (official weigh-ins are on Mondays). My short term weight loss goal is to beat Tyler from [344pounds.com](http://344pounds.com) to 199.9 lbs.  Previously I had missed that boat when he got below 200 lbs, but he put 25 lbs back on while I wasn't reading his blog, so I have a new opportunity to race him to the bottom now that he's losing again (even though he doesn't know me or know that he's racing someone).

I've still got a long, long way to go before I reach my ultimate fitness goals, but I'm glad that I am now back on track and headed in the right direction again. And you can come with if you want. All you have to do is decide that you want to do it and then make it happen. The only person holding you back is yourself.
