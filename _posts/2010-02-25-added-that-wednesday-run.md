I added the Wednesday run I talked about in my last post. I did 2.5 miles, running the entire distance. I'm pretty proud of that (it's the farthest I've ever run at one time) and the pace I was on put me at my goal of running a sub-40 minute 5K. That was a pretty good workout and I think I will keep a 2 to 2.5 mile run in my rotation.

Today, my Thursday runs bumped from 3 miles to 4 miles. The only part I walked were the two big hills (about 0.5 miles total). I probably could have run them, but I didn't want to run out of gas at the end. Despite walking those hills, I noticed that I bested my previous personal best for 3 miles by a full minute. Saturday is a 6 mile run and I'm hoping to do a 13:00 pace for that. We'll see.

**Training update:**
Exercise (yesterday): Ran 2.5 miles in 31 minutes and 39 seconds (12:40 pace)
Exercise: Walked and ran 4 miles in 50 minutes and 42 seconds (12:41 pace)
