        <p>Here’s a link to a talk about what happens to your fat when you lose weight.</p>

<p><a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-mathematics-of-weight-los-2">The Mathematics of Weight Loss</a></p>

<p>The subject of this talk is a very important thing to learn and makes me glad that I picked the name of this website to be what it is. This talk tells us that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water (84% and 16% respectively). This means that when you are trying to lose weight, the most efficient way to do so is to breathe more. It’s a bit more complicated than that, but the things that cause you to breathe more – running, sports, vigorous activities – are the very things that are getting the weight out of your body.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to watch this video. It’s very instructive and illustrates all of this better than I can here in a short post.</p>
