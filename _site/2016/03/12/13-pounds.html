        <p>When I started losing weight again, I weighed 290 lbs (although I think my official starting point was 288 lbs when this blog began). Now I weigh 277 lbs as of this morning and have for the past week. I’ve also been struggling with my eating the past couple of days.</p>

<p>In my most recent attempts at losing weight, dating back 4 years, I have really started to struggle with losing more weight after losing 13 pounds. I don’t know if it’s the weight or the timing. Usually by this time I’m several weeks in and I start struggling to control my eating. It slowly gets out of hand and I fall back into my old patterns of eating way too much of a bunch of junk.</p>

<p>I’m a that point now, teetering, struggling with the urge to eat more, to comfort myself somehow with a shovel-full of food. Which way will it go this time?</p>
