        <p>I made it to my goal weight of 280 lbs by March 1st. I weighed in at 279.4 lbs that morning. It feels good to have met that goal and people are already noticing and even I can tell the difference. My shirts arenâ€™t quite so tight and I have that little extra step of energy and that little less bit of pain when I move around.</p>

<p>Next goal is 270 by April 1!</p>
